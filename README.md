# Vanter Users Page :sparkles:

## This is my first API and first full stack app.

This app was created while i was learning about NodeJs and Express to create server side
applications. Then i thought about, How can i connect both front end and back end in a
single application using Js and NodeJs. At the end i build this simple but complete CRUD
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) application.

## What i learned building this project

Doing research i read about databases, html templates, user security, enviromental variables
and a lot of stuff that in the end i did not used in the project.

### The technologies used in the project

After some time researching, reading and watching a few videos, i decided to use:

**MongoDB** - NoSQL Database.
**Mongoose** - Module to interact with the DB.
**EJS** - HTML template used to read data from the Server/API.
**bcrypt** - Makes user's password more secure by hashing it.
**dotenv** - Creates enviromental variables hidden in the code base.

## What comes next in this project?

In the future i will revisit this project and do some refactoring (it is neccesary jaja)
and do it with way less routes and ejs files while maintaining the same or more functionalities and
post a few images, videos and/or host it to showcase it live in a real page.

**Thanks for reading! Feel free to dig in my repository and watch more code made by me.**
